# Genetic Algorithm (CE310 Coursework)

Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm created for the **CE310 – Evolutionary Computation and Genetic Programming** module under **Prof. Riccardo Poli**.  
All code is my own except for the provided fitness function.

---

## How it Works

- Random population of bitstrings is generated
- Fitness evaluated using provided function
- Tournament selection chooses parents
- One/Two-point crossover creates offspring
- Mutation randomly flips bits
- Weakest individual replaced each generation
